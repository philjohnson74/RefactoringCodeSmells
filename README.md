# RefactoringCodeSmells
This repo contains examples of refactoring Kotlin code for the code smells described by Martin Fowler in his book "Refactoring".

There are a series of articles on Medium indexed [here](https://philliptjohnson.medium.com/refactoring-code-smells-in-kotlin-db697ba980b2) that accompany this repo.

The general format is a before and after refactoring version of each refactor. One will be commented out as the class names will conflict.

To run a file in IntelliJ, right-click the file and click run.
